# "surfs up" Temperature Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis  
The purpose of this analysis is to evaluate weather trends in the months of June and December to determine if a sruf and ice cream shop is a viable business venture in Hawaii.  Using Python, pandas functions, and SQLAlchemy, we were able to query a database of temperatures to gather this information.

## Results  
Anecdotally, Hawaii is considered to be quite temperate, meaning there is little fluctuation in temperature year round.       Our analysis confirm this to be the case:

-As we see in the screen shots above, the average temperature varies by about 3 degrees from June to December.
-Another observation from the charts above: while the warmest day in June (85 degrees) isn't far above the warments day in December (83 degree), the coldest day in December (56 degrees) is significantly colder than the coldest day in June (64 degrees)

## Summary  
Based on our analysis, temperatures are consistent in Hawaii all year round, making it an ideal destination for travelers.  There are days in December that are much colder than the average day in June, so it could be expected that business would peak in traditional summer months.  Additional analysis on weather data to determine temperatures further in to summer and further in to winter would be more conclusive.  

Temperature is not the only factor in determining whether W. Avy's surf shop and ice cream stands will be successful.  Rainfall amounts are also a factor.
